Krishna Shah, Panguitch High School, Software Development
Your first Git repository is an essential part of your journey towards learning software development. The first file that exists inside my Git repository is special because it represents the starting point of my learning journey. It could be a simple "Hello, World!" program or an introductory README file. Regardless of its contents, this file symbolizes my passion for programming and my determination to learn more.
I'm a high school student who plays sports, I'm on student council, and I have a passion for anything technical  related, my goals are to later once I graduate find a job in software programming/development or cybersecurity specialist
My end goals are to start my own software related company that improves and secures our current point in the technical computer-related world
